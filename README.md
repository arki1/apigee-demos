# apigee-demos

Apigee Demos. This demo uses the BigQuery API method that runs a query and synchronously returns the results
to showcase how to implement and possibly monetize data-driven APIs.

**This is intended for learning/demoing pourposes only! Do not publish unrestricted API endpoints
that execute queries against your Google Project. It is an exercise for the reader to apply
the needed security policies, quotas, and caching!**
